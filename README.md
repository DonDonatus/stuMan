- [ ] add searching functionality, so that a user can say something like "find the conversation where my boss was telling me about the project workplan" and the system can search through previous conversations to find relevant information.
- [ ] look into how the AI can read all messages from the group effectively but only respond when directly tagged,mentioned or a task that it should do. For instance in awhatsapp group friends could be talking about food, or a a vacation plan... the moment someone says we could go this saturday(the AI checkcs the the timetable and realizes that there is an IA on saturday), or a conversation about football but when somerhing academkc related/something that it can do, it responds..

IDEA
[ now we have the mongodb set up and working
the next thing we want is the abaility to be able to save things to it
like a student says save this message "Your assessment is going to tbe 30% and next 3 weeks you will have a quiz"
the idea sounds dumb to me
but there are some messages that we just pin in whatsapp because they are important
later onw e can say soemething like fetch all the important information
or the message about the IA oro we can do same for documents too
so we upload a document and save it
later on we say give me the cpen 301 exam questions , or send]
